    <p>This syllabus is similar to a contract between students and the instructor, and as such it is quite long (with many sections required by the university). A few key points from this syllabus are highlighted here:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a> for all course communication. (See: <a href="#{{ "Communication Policy" | slugify }}">Communication Policy</a>)

      <li>You should be stuck for an hour on a problem before seeking help, but you should definitely seek help if you have been stuck for an hour. (See: <a href="#{{ "Getting Help" | slugify }}">Getting Help</a>)

      <li>Do not cheat. This includes working too closely with your classmates, or copying code or designs without attribution. (See: <a href="#{{ "Cheating Policy" | slugify }}">Cheating Policy</a>)

      <li>The portolio of work you complete for this class is public, which can be very useful for finding employment. As such, the more time you put into this class the more you will get out of it. (See: <a href="#{{ "Credit Hour Policy" | slugify }}">Credit Hour Policy</a>)
    </ul>

    <p>Students are still required to read through the entire syllabus below.</p>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Course Policies" %}

<p>This section includes miscellaneous policies specific to this course, including communication, attendance, credit hours, cheating, and more. These policies are <em>in addition</em> to the standard USF policies included later.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Communication Policy" %}

<p>Most course-related communication will be handled using <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>&mdash;a FERPA-compliant Q&amp;A platform that supports public, anonymous, and private posts. When making posts on Piazza, please keep the following in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make a <strong>public post</strong> when appropriate. This lets us answer questions once for all students. You can <strong>post anonymously</strong> if you are uncomfortable with attaching your name to a post or a response. When posting anonymously, your classmates will not be able to see your identity, but instructors will still be able to see your name (necessary to give you credit for participation and ensure everyone is following the code of conduct).</p>

    <p><article class="message is-warning">
      <div class="message-body">
        <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i>&nbsp;If you make a private post that should be public, you will be asked to create a new public anonymous post before receiving an answer.
      </div>
    </article></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Do not post code on Piazza. If you have a question regarding your specific code, please commit and push your code to your GitHub repository and post a link.</p>

    <p><article class="message is-info">
      <div class="message-body">
        <i class="fas fa-code"></i>&nbsp;Small code snippets (under 5 lines) are okay as long as they are not revealing a homework or project solution. For example, it is okay to post a small snippet from lecture and ask for clarification. It is not okay to publicly post the exact lines code needed to satisfy a participation or homework assignment.
      </div>
    </article></p>

  </li>

  <li><p>Make posts regarding grades or specific solutions <strong>private</strong> to the instructor and teacher assistants. When making private posts, they should always be marked as visible by both the instructor and teacher assistants so there is no confusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>, the instructor will also use <a href="{{ site.data.course.canvas }}">Canvas</a> to notify students of missing assignments or warn about low grades. Both the instructor and teacher assistants will use <a href="{{ site.data.course.github }}">Github</a> for project-related communication. You may also ask for help in-person during office hours, lectures, or lab sessions. Theses are the only officially approved channels of communication for contacting the instructor or teacher assistants.</p>

<p><span class="has-text-danger">Under <strong class="has-text-danger">no circumstances</strong> should you reach out to the teacher assistants via any other communication channel.</span> We want you to reach out to us for help, it just has to be via <em>official</em> channels. University policy states that instructors and teacher assistants must provide all students equal opportunity for course-related help. Using non-official communication channels turns a TA-student relationship into a tutor-student relationship, which is unfair to other students.</p>

<p class="has-text-grey"><em>For example, it is appropriate to use text messages to invite a teacher assistant to lunch as friends. It is NOT appropropriate to start asking that teacher assistant questions about the course during that lunch! It is also NOT appropriate to directly text message course-related questions to that teacher assistant, even if you are friends and were able to get help from them before. You can, however, ask that teacher assistant for help during official office hours.</em><p>

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>&nbsp;Any communication sent directly to the instructor or teacher assistants outside of official channels will redirected before being answered.
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Announcements Policy" %}

<p>All announcements will be posted on <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>. All students are expected to enroll in Piazza and monitor the announcements in a timely manner. This includes any changes to the lecture, office hour, or deadline schedule.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Attendance Policy" %}

<p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes to minimize disruption. Attendance is mandatory for all student presentations, guest speakers, and in-class exercises. Presentation dates will be posted on the course schedule.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Credit Hour Policy" %}

<p>All courses at the University of San Francisco must comply with the <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/sites/default/files/usf_credit_hour_policy_0.pdf">Credit Hour Policy</a>, which states:

<blockquote>
<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-sm"></i> One unit of credit in lecture, seminar, and discussion work should approximate one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per week through one 15-week semester. <i class="fas fa-quote-right fa-sm"></i>
</blockquote>

<p>As this is a 4 credit course, students must spend a <strong>minimum</strong> of 8 hours of out-of-class work per week to earn a passing letter grade. To earn a higher letter grade, students should expect to spend closer to <strong>10 to 15 hours per week</strong> on assignments.</p>

<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>&nbsp;The portolio of work you complete for this class is public, which can be very useful for finding employment. As such, the more time you put into this class the more you will get out of it.
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Cheating Policy" %}

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's Honor Code (<a href="#{{ "Academic Integrity" | slugify }}">see below</a>). In short, students must never represent another person's work as their own. Examples of honor code violations include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copying code or designs without attribution from the web
  <li>Copying from another student (past or current)
  <li>Having anyone other than yourself complete your work (including tutors)
  <li>Working too closely with others such that your code no longer represents an individual contribution
</ul>

<p><strong class="has-text-danger">Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/review-process">a report to the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC)</a>, and a report to the Dean.</strong> At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>

<p>There are other less tangible consequences as well. Most CS professors do not write letters of recommendation for students caught cheating (making it more challenging to get into graduate school or be competitive on the job market). Even if you are not caught cheating, it is unlikely you will do well in future technical interviews or on the job when cheating is not an option.</p>

<article class="message is-danger">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Unauthorized collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your submission and is a violation of the honor code.
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Policy Exceptions" %}

<p>Exceptions to most course policies are made only in the case of verifiable exceptional circumstances. This includes medical emergencies, mental health and well-being crises, or family-related emergencies. Extensions must be arranged prior to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>&nbsp;Have travel plans for a family event (such as a wedding or graduation) or academic/professional conference (such as Grace Hopper or an internship interview)? Contact the instructor ahead of time to make arrangements. Keep in mind you will likely be asked to submit assignments early versus getting an extension. Please note exceptions will not be made for other events (such as concerts, comic cons, and so on).
  </div>
</article>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Getting Help" %}

<p>A good rule of thumb is to seek help after you have been stuck for an hour. There are many ways to get help with this class:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Ask questions on <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a>. Most questions receive a response in under 24 hours (sometimes within 30 minutes). You may figure out your problem before you get a response, but then you can delete your question or mark it as solved.</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask questions during the instructor office hours. Office hours are first-come first-serve and there is lots of seating (including power outlets for charging).</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask the teacher assistants for help during their office hours, or a CS tutor for help at the <a href="http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/">CS Tutoring Center</a>. While they may or may not have a background in data visualization and/or JavaScript, it often helps to just talk about your code with someone (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>).</p></li>

  <li><p>Ask your classmates for high-level help or hints, but be careful! To avoid violating the <a href="#{{ "Cheating Policy" | slugify }}">cheating policy</a> and <a href="#{{ "Academic Integrity" | slugify }}">academic integrity policy</a>, make sure you never share code with your classmates or look at the code of your classmates.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>If you are feeling generally overwhelmed (including emotionally) and need advice, do not hesitate to reach out to the instructor. Since office hours can be crowded at times, you are welcome to schedule an appointment with the instructor via <a href="{{ site.data.course.piazza }}">Piazza</a> to chat in private.</p>

<article class="message is-warning">
  <div class="message-body">
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>&nbsp;Do not be tempted to cheat if you are struggling. There are <a href="#{{ "Cheating Policy" | slugify }}">serious consequences</a> to violating the University's <a href="#{{ "Academic Integrity" | slugify }}">academic integrity policy</a> and the student honor code.</p>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="University Policies" %}

<p>This section includes standard statements on University policies and resources, including: disclaimers on confidentiality, mandatory reporting, sexual assault; statements regarding USF's Honor Code and Academic Integrity and behavioral expectations; important campus resources for student health, safety, and wellbeing.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Behavioral Expectations" %}

<p>All students are expected to behave in accordance with the Student Conduct Code and other University policies (see <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/fogcutter/">http://www.usfca.edu/fogcutter/</a>). Students whose behavior is disruptive or who fail to comply with the instructor may be dismissed from the class for the remainder of the class period and may need to meet with the instructor or Dean prior to returning to the next class period. If necessary, referrals may also be made to the Student Conduct process for violations of the Student Conduct Code.</p>

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Academic Integrity" %}

<p>As a Jesuit institution committed to <em>cura personalis</em>&mdash;the care and education of the whole person&mdash;USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity.
