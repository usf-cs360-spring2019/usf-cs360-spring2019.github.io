## Speaker Requirements

Students must [select a relevant data visualization topic](data-vis-talk-topics.html), research that topic, and prepare a talk (either a slide-based presentation, live demonstration, or a mix between the two), and deliver that talk in class.

## Content

The required content for this talk includes:

  - The talk must be on a **pre-approved topic** in data visualization. See the [Data Vis Talk Topics](data-vis-talk-topics.html) guide for details.

  - All visual aids must be **properly sourced** (e.g. attributed to the content creator).

See the [Presentation Grading](presentation-grading.html) guide for details on optional content.

## Timing

The data vis talk should last for **15 minutes**. The presentation time may count up to 3 questions or 5 minutes (whichever comes first) from the Q&A session or an audience exercise. If there are no questions, the speaker should be prepared to fill the time with bonus material.

## Audience Requirements

Students that are not presenting are expected to be engaged audience members for every presentation, and provide speaker feedback. See the [Audience Requirements](audience-requirements.html) for more information.

## Presentation Grading

All presentations use the same grading rubric, and have the opportunity for extra credit. See the [Presentation Grading](presentation-grading.html) guide for details, and the [Presentation Advice](presentation-advice.html) for additional help.
