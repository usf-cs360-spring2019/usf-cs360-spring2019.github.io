Each person should have *flexible* presentation content to allow for adjustments in timing. If the presentation is running long, everyone should

Help each other out during the presentation. While one person speaks, another group member could be interact with the website or slides, or be keeping an eye on time. Have a pre-specified signal to give to each other if timing looks too short or too long.

Practice your presentation (individually and as a group), and pay attention to your pacing. Both practice and nerves can sometimes reduce the amount of time a presentation takes, requiring speakers to intentionally slow down the pace during the actual presentation. Build in pause breaks if necessary to help with pacing and transition between speakers.
