{% include section.html level="h2" name="Grading" %}

Speakers will be rated on a `U` (<u>u</u>nsatisfactory), `S` (<u>s</u>atisfactory), and `E` (<u>e</u>xcellent) scale in different categories as follows:

| Rating | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| `U` | The presentation did not meet the minimum requirements for this category. It is similar to receiving an `F` letter grade. |
| `S` | The presentation meets the *minimum* requirements for this category. It is similar to receiving a `C` letter grade. |
| `E` | The presentation excelled in this category, going beyond the minimum requirements. It is similar to receiving an `A` letter grade. |

Letter grades will be determined by the number of `U`, `S`, and `E` ratings received for each presentation as follows:

| Letter | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| `F` | **Two** or more categories receive an `U` rating, regardless of the ratings in the other categories. |
| `D` | **One** category receives an `U` rating, regardless of the ratings in the other categories. |
| `C` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher. |
| `B` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher and at least **one** category receives an `E` rating. |
| `A` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher and at least **two** categories receives an `E` rating. |

Additionally, `+` plus or `-` grades may be assigned at the instructor's discretion. For example, a borderline presentation may receive a B- letter grade, whereas an excellent overall presentation may earn an A+ letter grade.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Categories" %}

Speakers will be rated (see below) in several different categories. These categories are:

| Category | Rating | Description |
|:---------|:------:|:------------|
| **Content** | `S` | Must not have any required content missing from presentation. Required content is provided in the [individual guides](index.html) for each presentation. |
|             | `E` | Must not have any required content missing and no more than 1 optional content item missing from presentation. Optional content includes: an introduction to the speaker(s), an introduction (and/or background/motivation) section, a clear outline or strong organization, a conclusion with additional references to learn more if appropriate, and finally an invitation to the audience to ask questions. |
|             | `U` | Failure to meet the requirements for the `S` rating will result in an `U` rating for this category. |
| **Timing** | `S` | The presentation is no more than 25% under the required time. The presentation time may count up to 3 questions or 5 minutes (whichever comes first) from the Q&A session or an audience exercise. |
|            | `E` | The presentation is no more than 10% under or over the required time. The type of content that may be included in the presentation time is the same as above. |
|            | `U` | The presentation is more than 25% under the required time or more than 10% of the required time. The type of content that may be included in the presentation time is the same as above. |
| **Materials** | `S` | Must include basic visual aids to support the presentation; may not refer to content not currently being shown more than twice. Live presentations must not include more than 50% of pre-recorded content from the speaker (e.g. narrated demo video of a tool), and no more than 25% of other pre-recorded content not prepared by the speaker (e.g. excerpt a TED talk). |
|               | `E` | Must include rich, primarily speaker-created visual aids to support the presentation; may not refer to content not currently being shown more than once. Same requirements as above for pre-recorded content. |
|               | `U` | Failure to meet the requirements for the `S` rating will result in an `U` rating for this category. |
| **Delivery** | `S` | Must not have more than 3 issues with delivery. This includes: **volume** (i.e. speaking loud enough for entire room to hear), **eye contact** (i.e. not reading off notes entire time, maintaining eye contact with entire room), **energy** (i.e. not speaking in a monotonous tone, showing enthusiasm for topic), **speed** (i.e. not speaking too slow or too fast), and **clarity** (i.e. not mumbling, pronunciation is understandable). |
|              | `E` | Must not have more than 1 issue with delivery. (See above list.) |
|              | `U` | Failure to meet the requirements for the `S` rating will result in an `U` rating for this category. |

While the requirements above list hard cutoffs (e.g. no more than 25% over time, no more than 50% of pre-recorded content), the grading will conducted *during the presentation* and will necessarily rely on estimates.

Note that running overtime may have consequences for other categories. For example, it may prevent some of the required content from being covered and hurt the overall delivery of the presentation.

{% comment %}
**Content:**  To receive a S rating, the presentation must include a brief introduction to the speaker (including name and major) and must be organized well enough that the audience can state the presentation topic without confusion. To receive a E rating, the presentation must be clearly organized into a discernible introduction to the topic,  

Content. (organization, required sections)

Timing. (10-13 E, +/-2 S 8-10, 13-15, >2, < 8, > 15, U)

Materials. visual aids. powerpoint or something else.

Delivery. (Loud, eye contact, timing, engagement, clarity)

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Extra Credit" %}

Students may earn up to 10 points extra credit by signing up for an appointment at the [Speaking Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/) to prepare for one of the presentations. This can be for the [Data Vis Talk](/guides/presentations/data-vis-talks.html), the [Midterm Presentation](/guides/projects/midterm-presentations.html), or for help preparing the [Final Project Demonstration Video](/guides/projects/final-project-demonstration.html).

To book an appointment, go to:

<https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/make-appointment>

Keep in mind timing. You need to schedule the appointment with enough time to make adjustments to your presentation, but also need to have your presentation nearly complete by the time you have your appointment. However, there might not be any appointment availability left if you wait too long!

To earn credit, [submit the following information](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6823754) in Canvas **AFTER** your appointment:

  - Your appointment date and time with the Speaking Center
  - Which presentation/demonstration you were getting help with
  - One paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing what you learned from your appointment

Failure to include all the required information may result in a point deduction.

Students can make multiple appointments with the [Speaking Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/), but may only earn this extra credit once.
