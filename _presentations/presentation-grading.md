{% include section.html level="h2" name="Grading" %}

Speakers will be rated on a `U` (<u>u</u>nsatisfactory), `S` (<u>s</u>atisfactory), and `E` (<u>e</u>xcellent) scale in different categories as follows:

| Rating | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| `U` | The presentation did not meet the minimum requirements for this category. It is similar to receiving an `F` letter grade. |
| `S` | The presentation meets the *minimum* requirements for this category. It is similar to receiving a `C` letter grade. |
| `E` | The presentation excelled in this category, going beyond the minimum requirements. It is similar to receiving an `A` letter grade. |

Letter grades will be determined by the number of `U`, `S`, and `E` ratings received for each presentation as follows:

| Letter | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| `F` | **Two** or more categories receive an `U` rating, regardless of the ratings in the other categories. |
| `D` | **One** category receives an `U` rating, regardless of the ratings in the other categories. |
| `C` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher. |
| `B` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher and at least **one** category receives an `E` rating. |
| `A` | **All** categories receive at least a `S` rating or higher and at least **two** categories receives an `E` rating. |

Additionally, `+` plus or `-` grades may be assigned at the instructor's discretion. For example, a borderline presentation may receive a B- letter grade, whereas an excellent overall presentation may earn an A+ letter grade.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Extra Credit" %}

Students may earn up to 10 points extra credit by signing up for an appointment at the [Speaking Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/) to prepare for one of the presentations. This can be for the [Data Vis Talk](/guides/presentations/data-vis-talks.html), the [Midterm Presentation](/guides/projects/midterm-presentations.html), or for help preparing the [Final Project Demonstration Video](/guides/projects/final-project-demonstration.html).

To book an appointment, go to:

<https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/make-appointment>

Keep in mind timing. You need to schedule the appointment with enough time to make adjustments to your presentation, but also need to have your presentation nearly complete by the time you have your appointment. However, there might not be any appointment availability left if you wait too long!

To earn credit, [submit the following information](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6823754) in Canvas **AFTER** your appointment:

  - Your appointment date and time with the Speaking Center
  - Which presentation/demonstration you were getting help with
  - One paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing what you learned from your appointment

Failure to include all the required information may result in a point deduction.

Students can make multiple appointments with the [Speaking Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/speaking-center/), but may only earn this extra credit once.
