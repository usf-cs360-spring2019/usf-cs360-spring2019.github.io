Students must [propose a talk topic](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6829299) *at least* 1 week before the talk, but are strongly encouraged to select a topic much sooner. When approved, topics will be posted on the schedule above. Topics will be approved in the order they are submitted, regardless of when your talk is scheduled.

All students are encouraged to use the [Data Visualization Resources](/guides/general/resources.html) guide to find topics. Each student must select a unique topic and present content not already shown in class. Before submitting a topic, check the [class schedule](/schedule.html) and the [already approved topics](#approved-topics) above to avoid any overlap.

#### CS 360

For undergraduate students registered for CS 360, valid topics include any tools, techniques, examples, books, blogs, podcasts, or important persons (historical or current) in data visualization that have not already been discussed during class. The topics can be from the broader field of data visualization, including scientific visualization, visual analytics, information dashboards, data storytelling, informative art, infographics, and so on. The [General Topics](/guides/general/resources.html#general-resources) may be especially helpful for selecting a topic.

#### CS 560

For graduate students registered for CS 560, valid topics include any data visualization research paper published in an academic venue such as an academic conference or journal. Students are encouraged to choose a research paper that (a) the authors have posted a free PDF, (b) there is an available online demo, and/or media (such as high-resolution screenshots), and (c) there are presentation or demonstration videos publicly available. The [Open Access VIS](http://oavis.steveharoz.com/) resource may be especially helpful for selecting a paper.
