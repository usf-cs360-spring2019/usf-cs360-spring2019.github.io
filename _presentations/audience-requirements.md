All students must give several presentations throughout the semester. This guide focuses on the **audience** requirements for these presentations. See the [individual guides](./) on each presentation for **speaker** requirements.

{% include assignments.html %}

## Requirements

Students are expected to be **engaged audience members** for every presentation. This includes asking questions after the presentation and providing the speaker(s) 1 to 2 sentences of constructive and substantive feedback. Feedback will be given through graded pass/fail discussion assignments on [Canvas]({{ site.data.course.canvas }}).

Example feedback includes constructively encouraging the speaker(s) to speak louder or slower, asking followup questions about the topic, expressing interest in specific aspects of the talk, or complementing specific aspects of the presentation. Simple statements such as "Good job" or "Interesting topic" do not qualify.

Students, remember that you will be the one up there presenting at some point! Try to avoid doing things that you would not like to see during your presentation. For example, make eye contact with the speaker, no yawning or scowling, no chatting with friends on your laptop instead of paying attention, and help the speaker(s) avoid an awkward silence after the presentation by asking a friendly question. **Your engagement as an audience member is what will make this a positive experience as a speaker.**
