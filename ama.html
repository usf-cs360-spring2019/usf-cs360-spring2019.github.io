title: Ask Me Anything
---

<p class="is-size-5">Do you have 15-20 free minutes and a stable internet connection? Want to connect with and inspire a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students in the computer science and data science majors?</p>

<p class="is-size-5">Sign up to do a virtual AMA live for one of my courses!</p>

<h4>Content</h4>

<p>I'll ask you to spend ~5 minutes introducing yourself to the class, and then will leave the remaining ~10-15 minutes for students to ask questions.</p>

<p>I'll send out your biography ahead of time to the students, and will ask each student to introduce themselves before asking their question.</p>

<p>I recommend you have your favorite visualization (or two) ready to show off. Other than that, you should not need to do any prep ahead of time.</p>

<p class="has-text-grey"><em>*Students are instructed to keep questions professional, and must adhere to the Universityâ€™s code of conduct at all times in the classroom.</em></p>

<div class="notification is-primary">
<i class="fas fa-users-class"></i> Want to do something in-person? We also have a guest speaker series hosted by our local ACM student group.
</div>

<h4>Logistics</h4>

<p>The AMAs will be conducted virtually via <a href="https://usfca.zoom.us/">Zoom</a> (free), so no travel is required. The room link will be setup ahead of time, allowing you to test your setup. The AMA can <em>optionally</em> be recorded or livestreamed&mdash;that is completely up to you!</p>

<p>I can accommodate an AMA at the start of most lectures (except for activity or presentation days). The lecture schedule is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tuesdays, Thursdays at 12:45pm &ndash; 2:30pm
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I can suggest specific dates/times if you are interested.</p>

<div class="notification is-warning">
<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> This is my first semester hosting these virtual short-form AMAs, so expect a few technical difficulties at first.
