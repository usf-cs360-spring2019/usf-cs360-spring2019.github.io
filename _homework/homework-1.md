For this homework assignment, you must visualize the ???? dataset using various basic visualization techniques using [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

This guide details the requirements for this homework assignment. See the [Homework Submission](homework-submission.html) and [Homework Feedback](homework-feedback.html) guides for other requirements.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Dataset" %}

Students must visualize the [SFPD Incidents](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783) dataset for the month of December 2018. The exact dataset (with the date filter already applied) can be accessed and downloaded at:

<https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/December-2018/fuj3-tves>

There are 12,214 records in this dataset. Students are encouraged to apply different filters and aggregations to focus on a subset of this data. See the ["Columns in this Dataset"](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783) section of the dataset page for descriptions of the columns.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Grading" %}

The grade for this homework will be broken down as follows:

| Letter | Requirement |
|:------:|:------------|
| `D` | Prototype **3** unique visualizations in Tableau. |
| `C` | Implement **1** of the Tableau prototypes in D3. |
| `B` | Implement **2** of the Tableau prototypes in D3. |
| `A` | Implement **3** of the Tableau prototypes in D3. |

The teacher assistants have leeway to assign a `+` or `-` grade depending on whether the assignment was submitted properly and how well students completed the required functionality. For example, if a student completes `B` level functionality, the TAs will determine whether that student earned a `B-`, `B`, or `B+` letter grade.

{% include notice.html type = "is-info" icon = "fas fa-info-circle" text = "In general, homework assignments are designed such that achieving a <code>D-</code> to <code>D+</code> requires minimal effort, <code>C-</code> to <code>C+</code> requires some effort, <code>B-</code> to <code>B+</code> requires moderate effort, and <code>A-</code> to <code>A+</code> requires significant effort." %}

{% include notice.html type = "is-danger" icon = "fas fa-exclamation-triangle" text = "You may not earn credit for higher letter grades unless you have 100% completed the requirements for the lower letter grades first!" %}

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Requirements" %}

Create one image (or SVG) per visualization. Each image should be no more than 960 by 500 pixels. Visualizations may be placed on the same webpage or separate webpages. Regardless, the homework website must have clear navigation to each of the visualizations.

See below for the detailed requirements for each letter grade level.
