blurb: |
  <p>
    The alpha release of your final project should include one visualization prototype of your final project dataset in any tool desired. However, this should be a visualization you plan to implement in D3 version 5.
  </p>

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Requirements" %}

Create a prototype of one visualization you plan to implement in D3 version 5 of your dataset and include it on your website. On your prototype page, make sure to include the following information along with your prototype:

  - Include your goal for this visualization. This includes what you want users to learn from the visualization, and how it will fit in the overall narrative of your final project.

  - Include your planned interactivity. The prototype itself does not yet have to be interactive.

  - Include a description of how the data is encoded for your prototype. Be specific and use the appropriate visualization terminology. For example, "This is a scatterplot, where the date column is encoded as x position on a linear scale and..."

You may create your prototype in any tool, as long as it is based on actual data (so, a pen and paper sketch is unlikely to qualify).

You might end up *not* implementing this visualization in D3 depending on the feedback you receive and direction you decide to go with the project, but this release will not be helpful unless it is something you currently *intend* to implement in D3.

You might end up moving the location of the prototype on your website, but you should not remove it. For example, if you end up not implementing this visualization, this might end up in a dedicated "Prototypes" section. If you do implement this prototype in D3 version 5, you might include the prototype on the bottom of the page with that implementation.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Feedback" %}

Only half of the grade is associated with the prototype itself; the other half of the grade comes from seeking instructor feedback on the prototype.

To earn this credit, students must sign up for and attend a 15 minute one-on-one feedback appointment with the instructor. During this time, the instructor will provide verbal feedback on the prototype visualization. Written feedback will *not* be provided, but students are welcome to record the session.

These appointments will be scheduled for **April 22nd through 24th** via the [Canvas Scheduler](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10580-4212716665). Appointments are scheduled back-to-back; students must come on-time and may be cutoff at the end of their appointment time.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Submission" %}

The website alpha release is due on <strong>April 16 at 12:15pm</strong>. You must [submit a link in Canvas](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6821967) to a [release of your website repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) before the deadline. Name the release using the pattern `v0.1.x` where `x` starts at `0` and is incremented each time you make another release before the deadline.

You are welcome to continue making changes to your website repository after the deadline, but those changes will *not* be considered for your alpha release grade.
