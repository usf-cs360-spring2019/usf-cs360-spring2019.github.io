blurb: |
  <p>
    Instead of a midterm exam, all students must complete a midterm group project. This guide explains the requirements for the midterm group presentations. See the <a href="/guides/projects/midterm-project.html">Midterm Project</a> page for more details on other requirements.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Speaker Requirements" %}

All members of the midterm group must participate in the presentation of the project. It is up to the group to decide how to split the time between group members, but each person must speak for roughly equal time.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Content" %}

The required content for this talk includes:

  - The presentation must discuss the group theme.

  - The presentation must include all of the primary visualizations (one per group member), but the visualizations do *not* have to be presented by its creator.

  - All visual aids must be properly sourced (e.g. attributed to the content creator).

See the [Presentation Grading](presentation-grading.html) guide for details on optional content.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Timing" %}

The group presentation should be 5 minutes per group member. Therefore, a 2 person group must present for 10 minutes, a 3 person group must present for 15 minutes, and a 4 person group must present for 20 minutes.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Grading" %}

All presentations use the same grading rubric, and have the opportunity for extra credit. See the [Presentation Grading](presentation-grading.html) guide for details, and the [Presentation Advice](presentation-advice.html) for additional help.

{% include notice.html type = "is-info" icon = "fas fa-info-circle" text = "The presentation grade depends on both the entire group performance and individual performance, and will be assigned individually (versus a single group grade)." %}

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Schedule" %}

Each group must present their midterm project in class on week 9 (Tuesday 3/19 or Thursday 3/21). The presentation dates were semi-randomly assigned by the instructor, taking into account the size of groups and length of presentations. The presentation schedule is as follows:

| Start  | End   | Tuesday 3/19   | Thursday 3/21    |
|-------:|------:|:---------------|:-----------------|
| 12:50p | 1:10p | Dukes of Data  | Sigegoubi        |
|  1:15p | 1:25p | Team ColorIn   | Loop Troup       |
|  1:30p | 1:45p | Boom Graph R&D | The Data Vizards |
|  1:50p | 2:05p | Group0         | The Rad Grads    |
|  2:10p | 2:25p | Magic Mirror   | Tony and Friends |

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Audience Requirements" %}

Students that are not presenting are expected to be engaged audience members for every presentation, and provide speaker feedback. See the [Audience Requirements](audience-requirements.html) for more information.
