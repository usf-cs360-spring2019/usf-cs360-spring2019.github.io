Instead of a midterm exam, all students must complete a midterm group project. This guide explains the requirements for the midterm group presentations. See the [Midterm Project](/guides/projects/midterm-project.html) page for more details on other requirements.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Timing" %}

The group presentation should be 5 minutes per group member. Therefore, a 2 person group must present for 10 minutes, a 3 person group must present for 15 minutes, and a 4 person group must present for 20 minutes.

Presentations that are no more than 2 minutes short will receive an `E` rating. Presentations that are no more than 3 minutes short will receive an `S` rating. Presentations that are more than 3 minutes short will receive an `U` rating.

Presentations that exceed the time limit will be cut off, potentially affecting whether the necessary content was covered.

The presentation timing does *not* include the question/answer session at the end of the presentation.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Grading" %}

The midterm group presentations will be graded using the same metrics as the [Data Vis Talks](/guides/homework/data-vis-talks.html#grading) on a letter grade scale.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Dates" %}

Each group must present their midterm project in class on week 9 (Tuesday 3/19 or Thursday 3/21). The presentation dates will be semi-randomly assigned by the instructor, taking into account the size of groups and length of presentations. The dates will be announced shortly after the midterm groups are formed.

{% include section.html level="h3" name="Advice" %}

Each person should have *flexible* presentation content to allow for adjustments in timing. If the presentation is running long, everyone should

Help each other out during the presentation. While one person speaks, another group member could be interact with the website or slides, or be keeping an eye on time. Have a pre-specified signal to give to each other if timing looks too short or too long.

Practice your presentation (individually and as a group), and pay attention to your pacing. Both practice and nerves can sometimes reduce the amount of time a presentation takes, requiring speakers to intentionally slow down the pace during the actual presentation. Build in pause breaks if necessary to help with pacing and transition between speakers.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Audience Requirements" %}

Students are expected to be engaged audience members for every presentation. This includes asking questions after the presentation and providing the speaker(s) 1 to 2 sentences of constructive and substantive feedback. Feedback will be given through graded pass/fail discussion assignments on [Canvas]({{ site.data.course.canvas }}).

Example feedback includes constructively encouraging the speaker(s) to speak louder or slower, asking followup questions about the topic, expressing interest in specific aspects of the talk, or complementing specific aspects of the presentation. Simple statements such as "Good job" or "Interesting topic" do not qualify.

Students, remember that you will be the one up there presenting at some point! Try to avoid doing things that you would not like to see during your presentation. For example, make eye contact with the speaker(s), no yawning or scowling, no chatting with friends on your laptop instead of paying attention, and help the speaker(s) avoid an awkward silence after the presentation by asking a friendly question. **Your engagement as an audience member is what will make this a positive experience as a speaker.**
