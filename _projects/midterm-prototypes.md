blurb: |
  <p>
    Instead of a midterm exam, all students must complete a midterm group project. This guide explains the requirements for the midterm project prototypes, including the alpha and beta releases. See the <a href="/guides/projects/midterm-project.html">Midterm Project</a> page for more details on other requirements.
