blurb: |
  <p>
    Instead of a midterm exam, all students must complete a midterm group project. This guide explains the requirements for the midterm project prototypes, including the alpha and beta releases. See the <a href="/guides/projects/midterm-project.html">Midterm Project</a> page for more details on other requirements.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Alpha Release" %}

The goal of this assignment is to make sure your group is able to communicate and begin narrowing down a theme, is able to access the project Github repository and update the project website, and is able to make releases.

The following must be complete on your [midterm project website](midterm-website.html) for the alpha release:

  - The basic navigation and structure for the project website should be complete.

      There should be one page or section per requirement for the [midterm project website](midterm-website.html), including the home content, data and processing content, visualization content (one per person), prototype content, and team/about content. It should be clear how to navigate to all of the required content.

      The **content** of these pages or sections does not need to be complete, only the structure and navigation. Some of pages or sections will contain placeholders.

  - The "Home" content should describe the project theme (approximately 1 paragraph with 3 to 5 sentences).

  - The "Data and Processing" content must be complete for for the *original* dataset, but does not need to be complete for the data processing.

  - The "Team/About" content must be complete.

The content you include does not need to be the final version! You **may** continue to make modifications to the content later as your team works on the midterm project.

Once complete, your team must [creating a release](midterm-website.html#creating-releases) of your Github repository by the deadline and [submit a link]((https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6821963)) to that release on Canvas.
