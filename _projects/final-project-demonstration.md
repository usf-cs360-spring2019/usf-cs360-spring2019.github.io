{% include section.html level="h2" name="Demonstration Video" %}

You must create a 5 minute narrated video demonstrating your final project. Include the following in your video:

 - Introduce yourself, the dataset, and the overall narrative.

 - Provide a brief overview of all the visualizations you created for this project. In this overview, include how you encoded the data and the goal of that visualization.

 - Discuss at least one visualization in depth. Explain how the visualization fits into the overall narrative and its specific goal, detail the encoding, demonstrate the interactivity, and discuss one or two findings.

 - Discuss other visualizations in depth time permitting.

You do *not* need to show any prototypes or discuss the feedback in your demonstration video unless you have extra time. Focus primarily on the final versions of your visualizations.

Think 5 minutes is too short for all this content? For many academic conferences, papers have to create a *30 second* preview video! However, it takes considerable practice to create a concise video. You will likely have to make multiple attempts before being successful.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Video Recording" %}

You can use any software to record the video and audio. There are many other free options available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

If you use a Mac system, you can [record screencasts using Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721#quicktime) and save the video file. If you have a 4k display, you may want to [export the video in 1080p](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/export-movies-qtp20e395859/mac) to reduce the file size.

Students may also [download and use an upgraded version of Zoom](https://myusf.usfca.edu/ets/educational-technologies/zoom) for free by signing in with their USF accounts. You may either [make a local recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording) or [make a cloud recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203741855-Cloud-Recording) of your screen.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Video Showing" %}

<p>There will be a mandatory showing of the prerecorded final project demonstration videos in lieu of a final exam from 12:30pm to 3:30pm on Thursday May 16th. This date is listed on the <a href="{{ "/syllabus.html#important-dates" | relative_url }}">syllabus</a> and <strong>attendance is mandatory</strong>.</p>

{% include notice.html type="is-danger" icon="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" text="Failure to submit a demonstration video or attend the showing during finals week will result in a non-passing grade for your demonstration video." %}

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Submission" %}

You must upload a video file of your demonstration in Canvas by **12:15pm** on May 15th (the day before the showings). This is to give the instructor time to download and prepare for the final video presentations on Monday, May 15th.

**Do not leave this to the last minute.** Please keep in mind the time it takes to upload videos in Canvas.

{% include notice.html type="is-warning" icon="fas fa-calendar-alt" text="The deadline provided is when your video must be fully submitted by, not the when to start submitting your video! You may need to start the upload several hours earlier depending on your internet speed and file size!" %}

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Grading" %}

If students properly submit the demonstration video and attend the showing, then the videos will use the [presentation grading]({{ "/guides/presentations/presentation-grading.html" | relative_url}}) scheme (except some criteria, such as eye contact, will not be considered). Otherwise, videos will receive a non-passing grade.

{% include section.html level="h4" name="Extra Credit" %}

During the video showing, students will be asked to vote on their favorite videos. Winners will receive up to 5 points extra credit on their demonstration video grade.

Students may also earn extra credit by [making an appointment with the Speaking Center]({{ "/guides/presentations/presentation-grading.html#extra-credit" | relative_url}}) to prepare for the final demonstration video. Please note that this extra credit is not repeatable; if you already earned this extra credit for the midterm presentation or data vis talk, you may not earn it a second time.
