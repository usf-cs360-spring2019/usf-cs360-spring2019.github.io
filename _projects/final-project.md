{% include section.html level="h2" name="Requirements" %}

Students must choose a dataset and create a professional website with several informative and interactive visualizations of that dataset. Some of these visualizations *must* use D3 version 5, but other visualizations may use any visualization tool. See the [Final Website](final-project-website.html) requirements for more details.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Proposal" %}

Students must setup their final project website repository, as well as identify and describe a dataset for their final project. The instructor will *quickly* review the proposed datasets to make sure they will be appropriate for the final project. See the [Final Project Proposal](final-project-proposal.html) guide for details.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Releases" %}

Students must create several releases of their project websites:

| Release | Description |
|--------:|:------------|
| [Alpha Release](final-project-alpha.html) | Pending. The prototypes created for this release will be used in the instructor feedback exercise. |
|  [Beta Release](final-project-beta.html)  | Pending. The prototypes created for this release will be used in the [in-class feedback exercise](final-project-feedback.html). |
| [Final Release](final-project-final.html) | The final version of the website with all of the required content and visualizations. |

These releases must be submitted in Canvas by the deadline. See each section for additional details.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Feedback" %}

Pending.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Demonstration" %}

Instead of live project presentations, students must record and submit five minute final project demonstration videos. These videos will be shown during finals week in lieu of a final exam. See the [Final Project Demonstration](final-project-demonstration.html) guide for details.
