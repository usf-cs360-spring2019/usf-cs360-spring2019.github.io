blurb: |
  <p>
    The beta release of your final project should include your <a href="final-project-alpha.html">alpha release prototype</a> and one <em>new</em> visualization prototype of your final project dataset in any tool desired. This new prototype does not have to be one you plan to implement in D3 version 5.
  </p>

---

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Requirements" %}

Create a prototype of one visualization you plan to implement of your dataset and include it on your website. On your prototype page, make sure to include the following information along with your prototype:

  - Include your goal for this visualization. This includes what you want users to learn from the visualization, and how it will fit in the overall narrative of your final project.

  - Include your planned interactivity. The prototype itself does not yet have to be interactive.

  - Include a description of how the data is encoded for your prototype. Be specific and use the appropriate visualization terminology. For example, "This is a scatterplot, where the date column is encoded as x position on a linear scale and..."

You may create your prototype in any tool, as long as it is based on actual data (so, a pen and paper sketch is unlikely to qualify).

Make sure to **clearly mark** which is your alpha versus beta prototype. You will receive feedback from the professor on your alpha prototype, and from other students on your beta prototype.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Submission" %}

The website beta release is due on <strong>April 30 at 12:15pm</strong>. You must [submit a link in Canvas](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6821968) to a [release of your website repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) before the deadline. Name the release using the pattern `v0.2.x` where `x` starts at `0` and is incremented each time you make another release before the deadline.

You must also submit a link to your **project website** for both the [Beta Feedback (Tue)](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6840937) and [Beta Feedback (Thu)](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6840939) assignments. This gives students access to your website to view your prototype and the ability to fill out the evaluation rubric.

{% include section.html level="h2" name="Feedback" %}

Each student must present their beta prototype in two consecutive 20 minute feedback sessions. Approximately 10 minutes of that time should be spent describing the dataset (why you chose that dataset and what you want to learn from that dataset), and the beta prototype (including the goal of the visualization, the specific encoding used, and planned interactivity). The other 10 minutes should be spent answering questions as the audience provides feedback. (Some of this will be down time for presenters while the audience is writing feedback, so please come prepared.)

When not presenting, students must instead give feedback on the beta prototypes of others. Feedback will be given via Canvas rubrics similar to the homework feedback assignments. Students may ask follow up questions of the presenters as they provide feedback via Canvas. Students do *not* need to provide feedback on the alpha prototype.

{% include section.html level="h4" name="Schedule" %}

There will be two days dedicated to feedback (Tue 04/40 and Thu 05/02). Each day there will be four feedback sessions. Each student will present their project for two sessions, and then provide feedback for the other sessions.

Here is the schedule for an idea of what to expect:

| Start  | End    | Duration | Session                   | Presenters Should... | Audience Should... |
