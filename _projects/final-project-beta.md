blurb: |
  <p>
    The beta release of your final project should include your <a href="final-project-alpha.html">alpha release prototype</a> and one <em>new</em> visualization prototype of your final project dataset in any tool desired. This new prototype does not have to be one you plan to implement in D3 version 5.

The website beta release is due on <strong>April 30 at 12:15pm</strong>. You must [submit a link in Canvas](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1582982/assignments/6821968) to a [release of your website repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) before the deadline. Name the release using the pattern `v0.2.x` where `x` starts at `0` and is incremented each time you make another release before the deadline.

You are welcome to continue making changes to your website repository after the deadline, but those changes will *not* be considered for your beta release grade.
